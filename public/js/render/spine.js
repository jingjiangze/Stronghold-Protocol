//   clipPerAttack                         (enemies, GitHub #58) every attack plays the attack clip once — at its own
//                                         speed, faster only when the attacks come quicker than the clip, never

//   setSkill(on)                          the skill's begin clip, played out, then its own idle clip or its stance
//                                         between attacks (see the skill rules below); its end clip on stop

//   die()                                 die clip once (callers fade out afterwards); a skeleton without one holds its
//                                         idle clip's first frame (GitHub issue #25: the attack loop went on)
//   stunned (setBase('stun'))             stun clip, or the current track frozen at timeScale 0
//   setForm(roles, change, end)           another clip set of the skeleton (an enemy's mode, a 傀儡师's 替身), after a change clip
//                                         (no attack cuts the change clip short); `end` = { clip, in, roles? }: a
//                                         closing clip timed to end `in` s from now (a 重生's last clip ends with the
//                                         重生), landing in `roles`
//   update(dt)                            advances the skeleton (autoUpdate is off: one clock for everything)
//
// As the original (Arknights' battle animation is the authority; user reports: skill clips cut, sluggish and jerky
// attacks, Texas sliding, swings at nothing, fast and stiff):
//   - the renderer draws the battle ~1 game s behind the sim (app.js LOOK_AHEAD), so every attack is known before
//     it is shown: a swing starts only for a real attack, from its first frame, timed so that its strike frame
//     (OnAttack, manifest `hits`) lands on the attack. Nothing starts a swing on a guess;
//   - a one-shot clip (`Attack`) plays once per attack at its natural speed — sped up when the attack interval is
//     shorter, stretched at most ATTACK_STRETCH when longer (attackTimeScale) — then the operator idles until the next
//     swing; a begin / loop / end set (Texas: Attack_Start → Attack_Loop → Attack_End) plays its begin clip when the
//     unit engages, cycles the loop once per attack at a constant speed (clip / interval: never re-phased or sped up
//     to catch an attack) and, when no attack follows where its next strike falls, ends at the cycle's last frame
//     (the end clip's first: the three are authored as one continuous motion) with the end clip;
//   - a swing returns to the resting state of the moment it ends (an enemy blocked mid-walk idles, a unit whose
//     blocker died walks on), not the one it was wound up in;
//   - blends are given in real seconds (MIX: the battle runs at 2×) and never start before the strike frame;
//   - a target below the operator (more below than beside) takes the `_Down` clips (Attack_Down, Skill_Down_Begin, …);
//   - a skill's begin clip always plays out (attacks wait), an instant skill (on and off at once) still plays its
//     skill clip once, and the end clip plays out too — except a skill that ends while the unit plays its deploy clip
//     (乌尔比安's 【返回】 is a 【移动】 redeploy): that clip plays out, then the plain idle;
//   - during a skill an attack swings the skill clip that has the strike frame: its loop, or — a stance skill whose
//     loop has none (星熊: Skill_Begin strikes at the same frame as her Attack, Skill holds the shield) — its begin
//     clip; a skill clip without a strike frame (Texas' Skill, a sustained skill animation) is held, never swung;
//   - between attacks a skill with an idle clip of its own (anims skill.idle, not its loop: 折桠's Skill_2_Idle beside
//     the Skill_2_Loop jump attack, 史尔特尔's Skill_3_Idle; community report #23) stands in that idle (_ownIdle), and
//     its end clip plays only when the skill ends. Any other skill holds its stance — its loop: a skill mode (begin /
//     loop / end), a loop without a strike frame — while its attacks go on; SPELL_GAP attack intervals after the last
//     one the spell is over (_spellOver): its end clip, then the plain idle while the skill runs on (_rest; an attack
//     may cut that end clip), and the next attack goes straight back into the stance. The skill's real end plays its
//     end clip unless the unit already stands in the plain idle (owner's decision 2026-10-05, merging 0.1.3: 星熊, 宴,
//     塞雷娅 … end a spell of attacks as 0.1.3 does).
